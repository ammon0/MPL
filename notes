textual symbols in the source are macro replaced with a numerical expression such as a number for static variables, or a BP or SP relative offset. A temp symbol is also just some number that is in a register. All symbols must be explicitly dereferenced to get the "variable value". the dereference must specify the width.


// this is the same thing
load(temp val, sym ref, width)
dref(temp val, sym ref, width)

// this is the same thing
assign(sym ref, temp val, width)
store (sym ref, temp val, width)


array[i] would be translated to:

T1:= i		* array_step
T2:= array	+ T1

array_step would be a constant that would have to exist and be provided by the front-end.

structure.field

T1:= structure	+ field

where field would have to be a predefined constant
